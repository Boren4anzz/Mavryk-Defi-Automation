## ⚙️ Configuration

The bot reads wallet private keys from a plaintext file:

edsk...yourprivatekey2
...

````

All key configuration parameters are defined directly in the script:

| Parameter                  | Description                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `RPC_URL`                 | Mavryk RPC endpoint                   |
| `VAULT_FACTORY_ADDRESS`   | Vault factory contract                |
| `MVN_STAKING_CONTRACT`    | MVN staking contract address          |
| `LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT_MAV`    | Amount of MAV for liquidity           |
| `MVN_STAKING_AMOUNT`      | Amount of MVN to stake                |
